## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

In Singapore's vibrant music scene, emerging local artists struggle to gain visibility and connect with their audience, while music fans find it difficult to discover new local talent and stay informed about live events. Traditional music platforms are saturated with mainstream content, making it challenging for independent artists to stand out and for fans to find personalized music recommendations that match their tastes.

### The Solution

**Wavelength** is a comprehensive music discovery and events platform specifically designed to bridge the gap between local artists and music enthusiasts. Our platform provides:

- **Personalized Music Discovery:** Advanced recommendation algorithm that learns from user preferences, listening history, and interactions to suggest relevant local music
- **Live Event Integration:** Centralized hub for discovering and tracking live music events across Singapore with interactive maps and venue details
- **Artist-Fan Connection:** Direct interaction through follows, likes, comments, and notifications to build a thriving music community
- **Artist Empowerment:** Dedicated dashboard for artists to upload music, manage events, and analyze their audience engagement
- **Smart Analytics:** Data-driven insights for artists to understand their reach and optimize their content strategy

## How to Run the Application

### Development Mode (Local)

Run the application locally with hot-reload for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`

**Note:** The port may vary (5174, 5175, etc.) if 5173 is already in use.

### Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with optimized static files.

### Preview Production Build Locally

Test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting

Deploy the application to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
# Build the project first
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

For full deployment (including functions, rules, and hosting):

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Your application will be live at: `https://your-project-id.web.app`
